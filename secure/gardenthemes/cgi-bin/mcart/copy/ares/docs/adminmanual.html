      <p><font size="2" color="#000080"><font size="4"><a name="DataBaseIntegrity"></a>About Database Integrity?</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">A word of <b><font color="#FF0000">caution</font></b> and advice about database integrity.  Once you go live with the ARES system, you should let ARES manage everything from that point on.  You should not attempt to manage any of the data by editing it by hand.  Always use the ARES interfaces: Either the Admin Utility or the Affiliate Sign Up and Management screens.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Data is related through all the datafiles, and you just can't go deleting an Affiliate in the infofile.dat unless you are real clear on how to delete all info related to that Affiliate in the other datafiles for passwords, coupon rates, etc.  Likewise with Representatives.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">If you delete or edit information by hand, then the system will not crash, you could risk getting some very unpredictable results.  ARES know how to handle things.  You should just let it do things.  I already knows how to account for information changes, updates, transaction deletions, etc.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#000080"><font size="4"><a name="TwoRules"></a>Two Important Rules</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Rule Number One</b>: Do not turn off File Locking for  ARES &amp;  MOFcart scripts. By default, file locking is enabled. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Operating ARES with MOF requires that multiple files work with the same data in close range.  If you do not want to risk losing your data, then you should double and triple check that All File Locking settings are enabled throughout the ARES and MOF system. All File Locking is turned on in the distribution packages.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Rule Number Two</b>: Backup, backup, backup.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Databases are like motorcycle riders:  There are two kinds: (1) Those that have been down, and (2) those that are going down.  Backup all your *.dat files.  If you observe Rule Number One above you can feel very confident that your data will be safe, barring any server crashes, etc.  However, you should still practice good backup habits. The rule is &quot;Backup Often, Backup Quick.&quot;</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#000080"><font size="4">Email links everywhere?</font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Admin Utility will attempt to hyperlink all email addresses that it finds.  This is so you can click and call up your email program on the fly to send instant email messages to various Affiliates, Customers, or Reps related to the task you are doing.  You'll see this at various places in the Admin Utility as you navigate through functions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Example: You add a new Representative. On the confirmation message, click on the new Rep's email address to send an on the fly message to them. Or you change an Affiliate's earning rates (they are one of your top sellers).  The confirmation message will attempt to hyperlink their email contact to send messages.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#000080"><font size="4"><a name="LoggingIn"></a>If you have trouble logging in</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Always make sure you &quot;Log Out&quot; of the Admin Utility.  If you close your browser without actually logging out, then you will not be able to log in under the old password any longer.  You'll have to create a  new password, log in and out successfully at least once.  Then you can change the password back to the old one.  Folks usually only forget the Log Out touchiness once.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="4" color="#000080"><a name="ZeroOutFiles"></a>Zero out all datafiles before you go live</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">We recommend you get everything thoroughly tested to your satisfaction and then completely zero out the data files and start over with clean datafiles.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b><font color="#FF0000">Warning</font></b>: You should not attempt to manage the *.dat files manually, deleting individual records, because all 6 *.dat files have relational connections, and data is stored across all 6 files for a given Affiliate. The best way to preserve relational integrity among the data files is to let ARES manage everything. Once you are tested and ready to go live, simply zero out ALL the files and start over. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The only file that you could safely remove data from is the transaction log - activitylog.dat.  You can remove individual lines in this file safely.  You are permanently removing a transaction when you do this.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Backup</b> all your datafiles regularly,  and Insure that all File Locking settings are enabled on completely in the ARES and MOF scripts.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="4" color="#000080"><a name="UsingSearch"></a>Using the search boxes</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The search boxes <b>str</b> will allow you to search for that pattern in all fields for a Rep or Affiliate record.    You can use a period for a wildcard.  The pattern is not case sensitive.  The search will search All fields for a Rep or Affiliate to match on. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Tip: If you enter one or two periods into the search <b>str</b> box, then ARES will list all available records.  You probably don't want to do this with more than 100 or 200 affiliates, since the request will return a very long list to your browser.  But if you have under a few hundred Affiliates in your database, then it's an easy way to list them all, see when you have new ones, etc.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Note: The setting below limits the number of records that a search will return.  To have the Admin Utility return all records or more records, you'll need to narrow your search or increase the Allowed number of recrods that can be returned in the following setting:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">$NarrowCouponSearch = nn;</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Note: Your pattern or string must be found contained within a field.  In other words: A search for &quot;Belinda Williams&quot; will yield a No Records Found message because &quot;Belinda&quot; is in the First Name Field, and &quot;Williams&quot; is in the Last Name Field.  Hence, the pattern is not found contained in any field. The pattern really exists in two separate fields. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Just search for &quot;Belinda&quot; and you'll get where you need to go.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="4" color="#000080"><a name="FindNewAffiliates"></a>How to List new Affiliates that signed up?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The Admin Utility doesn't have a specific function to do this, however, here's some search tips that can help you accomplish it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Use a search pattern that will match on the Affiliate membership Start Date field.  The membership start date is always formatted with leading zeros this way <b>mm/dd/yyyy</b>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Example:  match all records for Feb 2001:  <b>str</b>: &quot;02/../2001&quot;<br>
        Example: match all new affiliates signued up  Feb 14, 2001: <b>str</b>: &quot;02/14/2001&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">We don't have date functions installed so you can't search by greater  or less than.  You're limited to searching for a specific day, or for the month.  You can search by the month, and send out personal greetings to each new affiliate from the search results page.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="4" color="#000080"><a name="HowToDelete"></a>How do you delete Affiliate-Reps from the database</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">You don't. The Admin Utility can delete or void transactions only.  The only reason you would delete a transaction is if it was a charge back, or the payment was not fulfilled for some reason, and you don't want to pay out earnings on an invoice that you never collected on.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Once an Affiliate or Rep has been entered into the database, then you don't want to delete them because they could have associated transactions, or a Rep could have Affiliate associations. ARES still needs all this information to create reports and stats.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>To nullify a particular Affiliate</b>:  Find their record and set both customer discount rates, and their earning rate to zero.  Any further transactions logged under their Affiliate Number will be zero earning transactions.  When you go to list all &quot;unpaid earnings&quot; the nullified Affiliate may show transaction records, but with no earnings.  You can safely &quot;pay&quot; the zero based earnings and that will update the transaction log.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>To nullify a particular Representative</b>: Find their record and set their earning rate to zero.  Also, conduct a search of Affiliate Records for that Rep Number, and edit each of the associated Affiliates to have a different Rep associated with them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">So, instead of thinking in terms of deleting Reps or Affiliates, think in terms of nullifying their earnings to your system, or configuring their settings in such a way as to nullify their activity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Another Trick </b>to limit or nullify a particular Affiliate or Representative's activity in your system is to assign a specific redirect URL to that Affiliate, redirecting anyone coming from their site (Affiliate Link) to a particular message on your site.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b>Another Trick</b> is to set the Override Previous Cookie to ON in the ares.cgi script. Then assign  a different Full Affiliate Link as a redirect URL for the nullified Affiliate.  </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">http://www.yousite.com/mcart/ares.cgi?ID=NEWNUMBER</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"> This effectively assigns a new Affiliate Number to all click throughs from the nullified Affiliate Link, stopping transaction activity for that Affiliate, and redirecting it to someone else.  Be careful not to put the system into an endless loop.  If you accidentally assign the nullified Affiliate's redirect URL with their own Affiliate Number, then you could create an endless loop.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="2"><font size="4"><a name="BecomeARep"></a>For Maximum Benefit Become A Representative</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We recommend you place yourself in the ARES system, both as a representative and as an Affiliate.&nbsp; You should be the first to register.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">
See more about this in the Operating Documentation.  You can have all Rates for Customer Discounts, Affiliate earnings, and Rep earnings set to zero if you want.  We suggest this because ARES can become a nice little way to analyze all your site's buying activity, but you need to have a default Rep and Affiliate for customers who don't arrive at your site from a real world Affiliate Link.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Setting up a default Rep and Affiliate allows you to keep All transactions made on your site for mailing lists, etc.  If you do not plan on using Reps, or the first level commissions, then you will want to make yourself the sole Rep in the database.   By doing this, you'll be able to create a complete report on all buying activity on your site, with a nice analysis grid of all Affiliate Activity.  You can get a one page summary of Affiliate performance for all Affiliates in your system.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">If you use both tiers, and have real world Reps you are using in the system, then you'll only be able to create these reports per each Rep.  You can see how each Rep's set of Affiliates are performing.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="3"><font color="#000080" size="4"><a name="RatesEffective"></a>When do newly adjusted rates become effective?</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The very next transaction following a rate adjustment from the Admin Utility will reflect the new rates. Rate adjustments are not retroactive.  If an Affiliate or Rep has pending transactions that were legitimately earned at an agreed upon rate, then their earnings remain.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">You can adjust Customer Discount Rates, Affiliate Earning Rates, Representative Earning Rates as often as you want, but any transactions that are posted are posted under the rates existing at the time it posts.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Representatives are not allowed to Sign Up online as Affiliates are. Only the Administrator can add new Reps to the database. You can only add new Reps via the Admin Utility.  The Admin Utility will assign the next available Rep Number based on what is already assigned in the database, incrementing the highest number found by the increment setting:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">	$RepCodeIncrement = 100;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The Admin Utility also can be set to a default Rep Starting Earnings Rate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">	$RepStartRate = 0;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">If you have Require Reps enabled for New Affiliate Sign Ups (signup.cgi), then a Rep is required for Each Affiliate who signs up. You'll have to have at least one Rep entered into the system for this to work. You can find more info about this in the Operating Documentation: <b>Setting up the Sign Up process</b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The New Rep is immediately available to the Affiliate Sign Up process as soon as you add them via the Admin Utility.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">When you have successfully added a new Rep to the database, the screen will appear back at the <b>LOGGED IN: ADMIN MENU</b>.

The only way to save the record is to click on the &quot;Add New Rep&quot; button below the Rep information input.  That screen will prompt you if any information is incomplete.

</p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">This function will list all Affiliates in the system who have Pending Earnings, i.e., commissions that you have not yet paid out or posted as paid out. Only those Affiliates with pending payments are listed.  It's a fast way for you to see who you owe earnings to.</font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">When you click this button you'll be taken to the <b>LISTING AFFILIATE EARNINGS</b> screen. All Affiliates with pending earnings are listed, with summary amounts for Pending Unpaid transactions, and Past Paid Transactions.   </font>

      <ol>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The &quot;<b>Select</b>&quot; link</font></li>

If you go there from the <b>LISTING AFFILIATE EARNINGS</b> screen, by default,  only the Payment Pending Detail list will show. Use the list to <b>select</b> what transactions you want to pay, then click on the &quot;<b>pay</b>&quot; arrow bottom right to generate a statement and update the transaction log.  See the previous  section on Affiliates to get more detail on this - <b>Payment Pending Detail.</b></font>
      <p><b><u>Pay All</u></b>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">This function will bypass the Payment Pending Detail selection choices listed on the <b>AFFILIATE ACCOUNT HISTORY</b> screen, and you will not get a choice of what pending transactions to pay or not.  This function will update and post <b>ALL</b> pending transactions for the Affiliate, and then present you with the <b>STATEMENT</b> screen.</font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">Warning</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">: If you use this you should be sure there are no pending invoices that need to be voided for non payment.</font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The &quot;Transaction Management&quot; section has this function. You'll need the exact Invoice Number to enter into the &quot;Find&quot; Box.  You can't enter a part of the Invoice Number and get search results.  You should know the exact Invoice Number or you wouldn't be trying to void it.</font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Enter the Invoice Number into the &quot;Find&quot; Box.  If the invoice is found, you'll be presented with a &quot;<b>Delete Invoice #####</b>&quot; button.  You'll also see a message to the right of the button about what you are getting ready to delete.  The message will confirm the Invoice Number, Date, Amount, and Affiliate Number associated to the transaction.  Check that it is correct, then click the &quot;Delete Invoice ######&quot; button. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Nothing will be deleted unless you click the &quot;Delete Invoice #####&quot; button.  It is safe to click on any other button on the page at this point and the screen will refresh without your &quot;Find&quot; Invoice Number to delete. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">If you click the &quot;Delete Invoice #####&quot; button, the Invoice will be deleted from the transaction log as if it never existed.  You will return to the LOGGED IN: ADMIN MENU and a confirmation message will appear stating:</font>
      <p><font color="#990000">Successfully Deleted Invoice # Number</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><b><font color="#FF0000">Warning</font></b>: The invoice will be gone as if it had never existed.  So if you delete an invoice that has already been included in creating an Affiliate or Rep <b>STATEMENT</b>, then the information will be gone. It will not be listed any longer in the Rep's or Affiliates Account History.  Be careful to pay Rep or Affiliate earnings only on invoices where the customer's payment has cleared.</font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">You can create an <b>ASCII</b> text file containing email addresses from the Make Mailing List function.  Sorry, we did not include automated sendmail abilities in this feature because if the lists are very long, then you wouldn't want to bulk mail from the browser this way.  So, we only created the ability to create the list.</font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Give a name to the File that you want to create. The file will be created in the directory you have defined in uadmin.cgi settings for:</font>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Select the options you want from the right area, and click the &quot;List&quot; button.  A file will be created in the pathway above containing the email addresses that match your options selected.  If the file already exists you will get a &quot;File Already Exists&quot; message.  This is to prevent you from overwriting any important files on your server.</font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Email addresses for customers come from the entire transaction log</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Email addresses for Affiliates come from the Affiliate database</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Email addresses for Reps come from the Rep database</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">If the email address file was created successfully you'll get <b>MAKE MAIL LIST </b>&nbsp;confirmation screen, which summarizes the mail list file, how many addresses, what options you selected, etc.  You can go to the location it says and download your file.   Use the file to import into another database for mailing, or to use for any bulk mailer program.</font></p>
