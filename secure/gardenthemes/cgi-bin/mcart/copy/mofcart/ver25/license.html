  <TD><p class="DefaultText"><strong><u>MerchantOrderForm Shopping Cart v2.5</u> Perl Code is clean, well organized, open source code. I have made no attempt to condense or scramble the code, as that would render the Package less suitable for customizing. It was a mamouth effort to produce and package. Please respect the licensing restrictions, distribution limitations, and modification Terms & Conditions outlined below. </strong> </p>
    <p class="DefaultText">A copy of the MerchantOrderForm Shopping Cart License can be found at: 
      <a href="http://www.merchantpal.com/license.html" target="_blank">http://www.merchantpal.com/license.html</a>
    <p><span class="DefaultText">MerchantOrderForm Shopping Cart v2.5 & ARES (Affiliate Referral Earnings System) v 2.4 are copyright (c) 2000 -2004 Russell Alexander, Austin Contract Computing, and MerchantPal.com (tm). "Merchant OrderForm" & "MerchantPal.com" are trademarks of Russell Alexander. </span>
    <p><span class="DefaultText"> This license statement and limited warranty constitutes a legal agreement ("License Agreement") between you ("Licensee", either as an individual or a single entity) and Russell Alexander (Austin Contract Computing, Merchant OrderForm) ("Vendor"), owner of the "Merchant OrderForm" shopping cart, and "Merchant OrderForm" related programs, the ("Software Package") of which Russell Alexander is the copyright holder. </span>
    <p><span class="DefaultText"> BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THIS SOFTWARE PACKAGE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT.
    </span>
    <p><span class="DefaultText"> Upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the License Agreement, MerchantPal Services, Russell Alexander, & Austin Contract Computing grants you the right to use the Software Package in the manner provided below. </span>
    <p><span class="DefaultText"> If you do not accept the terms and conditions of the License Agreement, you are to promptly delete all copies of the Software Package from your computer(s) and/or server(s).
    </span>
    <p><span class="DefaultText"> The Vendor reserves the right to license the same Software Package to other individuals or entities under a different license agreement.
    </span>
    <p><span class="DefaultText"> This Software Package is licensed for <b><u>Installation Only</u></b>. The Software Package, and all files included in the Software Package, either individually or together, cannot be sold outright & cannot be distributed or downloaded, to any person or entiry, outside the number of Installation Licenses Purchased. The Software Package cannot be modified and then sold as a package or component, either individually or together. </span>
    <p><span class="DefaultText"> You may install, modify, test, enhance, customize, and use the Software Package, as an "in service" web application, either individually or together, on the number of web sites you are licensed for. Licenses are available in (1) Single User Licenses, (2) Web Developer Licenses, (3) Special Negotiated Licenses. <b><u>All copyright (c) notes commented in the scripts must be unaltered</u></b>. Only a (3) Special License may alter the copyright (c) notes commented in the actual scripts, and only as outlined by the Special License.
    </span>
    <p> <span class="DefaultText"><b><u>Single User Licenses</u></b> grant you rights to install, modify, test, enhance, customize, and use the Software Package in any way you need, for one (1) web site. The Software Package resides as a web application on one (1) existing server, and for one (1) primary web site project. It is permissible to run a Single User License at one location, but have several web sites posting input to the cart. The Software Package is primarily "in service" on one (1) web site, and one server. </span>
    <p> <span class="DefaultText"><b><u>Multi-Site Licenses</u></b> (Web Developer Licenses) permit the Licensee, rights to install, modify, test, enhance, customize, and use the Software Package in any way needed, for the number of Installation Licenses Purchased. The Software Package resides as a web application on only the licensed number of Installation Sites, and primary web site projects. This license is intended for Web Developers who want to include a Shopping Cart as part of a larger project, or for Web Developers who want to install only the Shopping Cart as a service. In either case, the Software Package cannot be made available for download, nor can it be set up as a Package in an automated installation service. The Developer is expected to charge whatever professional fees are associated with either a larger project bid, or the installation service. The End User Client cannot sell, or otherwise make available to a person or entity, the Software Package the Developer has installed. The End User has rights to modify, test, enhance, customize, or use in anyway needed, but may not sell or distribute as a package or component, either individually or together.
    </span>
    <p> <span class="DefaultText"><b><u>Special Licenses</u></b> are required to do anything outside the concept outlined in this agreement. Use of the Software Package, either individually or together, as a <b><u>Remote Shopping Cart Service</u></b>, or use of the Software Package, either individually or together, as a component of a <b><u>Hosting Service</u></b>, or inclusion of the Software Package, either individually or together, as a component of a <b><u>Shareware or Freeware compilation</u></b>, download service, or script <b><u>collection service</u></b>, require a Special License. Please contact me if you have any of these type needs. Hosting Licenses are quite affordable, compared to some of the other Cart Packages available. In any of the cases above, the person or entiry involved, needs to have a Special License Registration on file with me--MerchantPal.com (tm), Russell Alexander, or Austin Contract Computing. 
  
    </span>
    <p> <span class="DefaultText"><b><u>Backup</u></b> copies are not considered "in service" installations. <b><u>Transferring</u></b> the Installation to a different server than originally installed is permitted, as long as one (1) Installation License appears "in service" at any one time. Modifications are permitted by eithr the Single User or by the Developer and/or Developer End User. The basic concept is that any particular installation that appears to be "in service" requires an Installation License, whether the License was purchased by the End User (and installed by another), a Single License (installed by a do-it-yourselfer), or one of the Installation Licenses used as part of a Developer's Multi Site License. In any of the cases, the Installed or modified Software Package may not be sold or distributed, either individually or together. </span>
    <p><span class="DefaultText"> The Software is provided "as is". In no event shall MerchantPal Services, Russell Alexander, or Austin Contract Computing be liable for any consequential, special, incidental or indirect damages of any kind arising out of the delivery, performance or use of this Software, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. While the Software has been developed with great care, it is not possible to warrant that the Software is error free. The Software is not designed or intended to be used in any activity that may cause personal injury, death or any other severe damage or loss. </span>
