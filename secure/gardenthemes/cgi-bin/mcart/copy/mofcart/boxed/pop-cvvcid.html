An important new security feature for card-not present transactions now appears on the back of most Visa cards. This new feature is a three-digit value which provides a cryptographic check of the information embossed on the card.<br>

    <td colspan="2"><b>CVV2&#146;s Location</b><br>
The CVV2 three-digit value is printed on the signature panel on the back of Visa cards immediately following the Visa card account number.<br>
<div style="margin-top:5px" align="center"></div>
The CVV2 value helps validate two things:
<ul>
  <li>The Customer has a Visa card in his/her possession.
        <li>The Card account is legitimate.
      </ul>
CVV2 is printed only on the back of Visa cards--it is not contained in the magnetic stripe information, nor does it appear on sales receipts. </td>
