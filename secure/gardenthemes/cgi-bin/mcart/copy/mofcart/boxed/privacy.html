Your billing name, address, and purchase details are retained in our secure databases. We do not store or mail your credit card numbers. Credit card details are processed via a secure gateway to Bank of America merchant services transaction servers. 
        If you prefer, we have provided several alternate methods for online purchasing of our products and services: You may mail in your payment, or request a traditional phone call to obtain your credit card details.
        If using the PayPal service to checkout, all billing information is provided once you are passed off to their secure transaction servers at PayPal. They handle everything.      </p>
