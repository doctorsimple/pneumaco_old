          <p>Welcome</p>
          <p><br>
            Plant It Herbs is a research and education facility, and specializes 
            in growing nursery-propagated Chinese medicinal plants. The gardens 
            contain perennials, annuals, vines and shrubs used in Chinese medicine 
            for over 3000 years. </p>
          <p>Currently, about 250 species of Chinese medicinal plants are growing 
            on the grounds. In 2001 Plant It Herbs applied for Sustainable Agriculture, 
            Research and Education (SARE) grant from the USDA. In July 2002, the 
            grant was awarded and a Chinese medicinal plant study was begun to 
            determine the medicinal quality of five important plants. While we 
            now know many important Chinese medicinal plants grow well in southeastern 
            Ohio, it&#8217;s not yet known if plants grown in Ohio soils will 
            produce good quality medicine. </p>
          <p>Research is being conducted on five Chinese medicinal plants grown 
            on three separate sites in southeastern Ohio. Three medicinal mushrooms 
            grown on five local hardwoods are also being studied. The plants and 
            perhaps even the mushroom material will be tested in China for quality 
            and constituent assessment. Qualified experts in the field of study 
            will also evaluate organoleptic analysis of the plant material. <br>
          </p>
          <p>Plant It Herbs is supported in part by a second job managing the 
            national office for United Plant Savers, (UpS) www.unitedplantsavers.org 
            United Plant Savers is dedicated to the preservation and conservation 
            of native medicinal plants in the US and Canada and serves as one 
            of the most reputable organizations working to protect these valuable 
            plant treasures.<br>
          </p>
          <p>In addition to the research work being conducted at Plant It Herbs, 
            workshops are offered, educational support and some mail order plant 
            sales. Please check the workshop page for updates in the fall schedule. 
            Mail order plants will continue to be offered but not on demand as 
            in the past. Orders will be processed and checked for availability. 
            Most orders will be shipped in the summer or as they are propagated. 
            Seed sales have been discontinued because they take too much time 
            to process. Sorry.</p>
          <p>This season the gardens are beginning to be converted using biodynamic 
            methods. Plant It Herbs is excited to incorporate this important step 
            into our gardening practices. </p>
          <p>Please contact us at Plant It Herbs if you have additional questions 
            about any of our ongoing projects.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Thank you. Enjoy.<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">
