What: Hey Charlotte,

re mask just to confirm what we've said in our previous emails:

"In terms of the mask, yes it is the minx one please. I absolutely loved the mix of colours you used on your website ie white (predominant colour), greys black (loads of fluffy fluffness) It needs to be on a stick for ease of removal onstage. Veil, up and round the top for effect but none down the back to interfere with my hair."
Something super fabulous!!


Thanks again.

What: Hello I acually have a couple of questions first  please. The design Victorian Fuschia is that pretty true to the picture you have posted? 
   My daughter has a formal and her dress is a fuschia color the theme is Phantom of the Opera/ Mascarade I know there are several colors of fuschia but the picture looks as thought it would match well with the different shades of colors and her date is wearing a black tux so I feel based off of the pic on you site it will do well, but since each one is hand done I just wanted to know. Your site is great what beautiful works of art! Looking forward to hearing from you soon. 
    Her formal is in a few weeks so if I order this I would get it shipped two day as I would like to surprise her with it at Easter. Thank you again.

Sincerely,
Mary Ward

What: Charlotte,

We love your website and the designs you have created.  It's refreshing to know that we could support a local artist as opposed to some import.  We would like to e-mail you a photo of the the gown Anne will be wearing to the Rose Festival Masquerade Ball.  We would like to do a his and hers mask from style 13 on the eye masks with a stick.  I would like to dress Annes up with long black and white feathes off of one side and perhaps some hanging beads or ribbons off the other side. She prefers platinum (silver) to the gold.  

Would you e-mail us so that we can discuss the design and get an order placed with you.

Conrad and Anne

What: Charlotte,
   My husband and I are leaving on a cruise July 23rd of this year, on which there is a masquerade ball. I am interested in having masks made for this ball. My dress is very funky and I would like the mask to match. I was wondering how I could do this and was if it would be possible to send small spools of thread in the colors of the dress to you? I would like my mask to be quite ornate but with no netting and on a stick, with my husbands to match. Please either E-Mail me or call me with a quote and your ideas. Looking forward to hearing from you.
    Sincerely.
    Laura

What: I would like the ICE Queen mask please.  I need this mask by the 28 Aug 09.  The APO address is a military address and the package will be send to New York and delivered by US Forces Mail.  I am guessing it will take a week to make it here once it it delivered to NY.  Which gives you about a 2 week turn around to make it and mail it.  Let me know if this is do-able.  Are the masks tied by ribbon or elastic in the back (it has to remain on for an extended period of time)?  Thanks

What: Hi Charlotte,

I just sent you an email of the mask that I would like to order: the $70 fantasty ice queen mask with a stick.  The description was "Glittering winter silver and white addorned with ostrich and marabou, beads and a lavish veil.  It is located in between the flame queen and the night queen..this sounds like it will match my dress which is white satin with rhinestones and crystal (more silver undertones.)

Please let me know if it is possible to have both strings to wear and stick to hold.  Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.

Have a great weekend.

  I would like to order the $65 Persian queen mask with:
     black feathers and hot pink/fuschia feathers 
     ribbons colors that blend well with the feather colors
     black and hot pink/fuschia colored mask 
     BUT WITHOUT the veil(can I just have extra feathers or ribbons instead of the veil?).
  
  If you email me, I would like to reply to you and email a photo of my fitness competition costume that I want to wear with this mask. By the way, I'll be wearing a fake tan at the competition so my skin will be darker than shown.

If you think you can make my mask, I can email you again with my credit card number.
Sincerely,
Christine Huang

What: Hello Charlotte,
I found your site while searching for Ohio Homesteaders/backyard food gardeners for a new video series I have begun. You Garden page came up and I found it to be very interesting. I searched around more through your site and what caught me was your comment "What do Masks and gardening have to do with each other? Everything!". I am one who believes a food garden should not just feed the body but the eyes, mind and soul of the person. Putting art form into the garden. Making it a place of enjoyment. Your own little world. I am always expressing to others put ART back into the garden. Make it a magical place while you grow your food.
The purpose of my writing you is to find out a little more for my project. Do you currently food garden? Do you have livestock? Would you say you would be somewhat of a self sufficient or homesteading lifestyler?
I ask because if the above would be a yes, I truly would LOVEto spotlight you in one of my videos. Showing the inspiration of combining Art and garden in a different way. You draw inspiration from it. I would like to show the garden through a new pair of eyes to my viewers.
This video series has just begun. I am not a pro nor do I have prior experience in the industry. I am just an everyday person living a little different then my neighbors. Hoping to inspire and open the eyes of others through my blog and videos of adventures in Homesteading. Showing it is not what they see on T.V and it is not just something done by religious followers.
Here is a link to my blog with the videos:
www.unusuallyunusualfarmchick.blogspot.com
If you would be interested, please do write me back. I live in the Akron Canton area of Ohio and would love to make a day trip your way with my camera guy.
Hope to hear from you soon,
~Tammie

Yes, I can work on it this weekend and get it out on Monday three day select UPS.  The mask will be $45 and the shipping to NC will be $14.  Do you want a veil on the mask or not?  And did we decide on no stick but the elastic band; all the Victorian Fuchsia color scheme?  Please confirm just to make sure when you order.  
I will send you an email when I ship wit the tracking number.
Thanks so much!
Charlotte


Charlotte,

She wants the colors to be Victorian Fuchsia, black and silver color scheme. No veil. She wants an elastic band. This is her last prom and we want it to be memorable. I appreciate all of your help and promptness to this matter. Her prom is 05/01/10. I will send you a picture of her with the mask after the prom. I think you should start a gallery of pictures for people who bought masks. Below is my payment for the $45.00 plus $14.00 shipping.

Thank you,

Crystal Smith

What: Your masks are fantastic! In my fantasy life, I would have one of each and wear them daily depending on my mood but in "real" life I have a dilemma I hope you can help me solve. Each year, I throw a huge Halloween costume party (100+ people) and this year I want to create my version of Maeve, the faerie queen of winter, as I visualize her from Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden novels. I've been thinking of this idea for a few years and have always envisioned your Ice Queen mask as the perfect piece around which to build the costume. So, why don't I just order one? I live in south Florida and believe me Halloween is not cool and crisp autumnal air here. Also, as hostess, I'm constantly moving around through the throngs and working up a sweat (trust me, it limits my costume options) so I was wondering if you could create an Ice Queen headdress - the same exotic, erotic, glaciar queen look without the mask part. Yes, it removes part of the fantasy, but with the weather and inside/outside nature of my costume bash any sort of mask is not a good idea. If such is possible, could you please send me a quote? I would much appreciate it. Thanks! and thanks for sharing you incredible imagination and creations.

What: Hi Charlotte, I wrote last week asking you about the possibility of making an Ice Queen headdress rather than using a mask and uyou replied that would be possible. I finally got to the storage unit and unearthed the box with the wig I'm planning on wearing and got it styled so that I could provide you with a "hat" measurement, which is 23". You mentioned that since there's not going to be a face you would additional adornment on the back and/or sides. Soundsgreat to me! The more the better. The headdress is going to be the center piece of the costume. If it helps at all to see what I have in mind, Pyramidcollection.com has a dress (item P87-681) in black that I am using as the general look, only I am doing it all in silver and white for the Ice Queen theme. I would like to have the headdress by mid-October since it's for Halloween. Sooner is great but I will be away the first ten or so days of October so will not be able to tell you how fantastic it looks. I'm excited; I've been wanting to base a costume around one of your pieces for a couple of years. If you have questions or need further information, let me know or give me a call. Thanks!

What: I really like the masks that you have available and was hoping that you can customize one for my wedding since I am having a Halloween Masquerade ball on October 27, 2012.

I really like the looks of the Minx Queen.  Specifically I like the contrast of the white, black/white, and the occasional black feathers as well as the veil. A few things that I was hoping that could be changed are the removal of the black feathers by the ears, the long draping feathers by the ears, and the beading on the mask itself. I was also wondering if it is possible to have a plain white mask. I have some of my own beads that I want to put on the mask.

Can you let me know what the cost would be for the order and when you could get have the order done?

Thank you!

Erin

What: Dear Charlotte:
I love the Flame Queen  She looks perfect for my fire costume I'm creating for Halloween.  I too love it and begin early (my husband will be ice -sadly he won't wear a mask)
The colors in your mask looks to be orange and yellow which are my primary colors so far along with splashes of red and black. 
Obviously I'm not in a huge rush since this is for Halloween.  If you have any questions please call.
Your designs look fabulous!  The best I've seen and I have been searching.

Also my shipping address is not the same as the billing(that's our office):
