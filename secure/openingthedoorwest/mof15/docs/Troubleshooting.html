<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Please note, we have included some of the more common problems that folks have in getting Merchant OrderForm up and running.&nbsp; Overwhelmingly, most questions we get for help installing Merchant OrderForm are from those inexperienced in installing
CGI scripts.&nbsp; Seasoned cgi installers, have made it through the learning curve, and can usually troubleshoot their installation.&nbsp; Those not so experienced with cgi installations, can miss some very subtle things, and can get stuck.&nbsp;
The less experienced cgi installer's problems are invariably a subtle oversight with some small setting, some small procedure.&nbsp; There are lots of different procedures, configuration settings, server settings, server protocols, files, images that
must come together for Mof to be installed and operating flawlessly.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
The distribution package has all configuration settings at a minimum, so we can eliminate some of the more complex installation issues at first.&nbsp; The idea is to get Mof up and running with all the examples as they come out of the package, and
then you can begin to customize your install to fit your site, one thing at a time.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
We'll put a little section on the problems most folks encounter when attempting to install on an NT server, under MIIS, but you really should know what you're doing with cgi installs under NT and MIIS, before you even try to do this on NT, else
you're in for a pretty good struggle.&nbsp; You have to clearly know the ins and outs of how NT and MIIS handle absolute pathways and file-directory privileges, and especially how to use a sendmail compatible mailer under your MIIS so that Mof can
mail your stuff.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
For Unix-Linux type servers, running Apache (or anything else is fine), then the less experienced cgi installer will usually encounter three levels of problems:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
The <b>first</b> level of problem has to do with getting the scripts to run on the server. These type of problems cause Internal Server Errors.&nbsp; This is a message from the server that the cgi program you attempted to run did not run correctly on
the server.&nbsp; This is not a Merchant OrderForm error.&nbsp; It is your server telling you it could not run the script for one reason or another.&nbsp; Follow the 500 Internal Server Error checklist until you get it right.&nbsp; When both main
script files are up and running in<a href="file:///C:/Working4/Installation.html#TestMain"> test mode</a>
 as we have described in the Installation, then you are ready to tweak out all the ways that Mof will operate on your site.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
The <b>second</b> level of problems occur after the main Mof script files are running on the server, but Mof is not operating successfully in one or more processes.&nbsp; This is the number one, hands down, most common request we get from folks about
installation problems.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Once Mof is running on the server, then any messages you receive in your browser that say ..</font><p><b>Merchant OrderForm v1.53 Data Processing Error</b><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
.. are messages from Mof to you telling you exactly where the problem is.&nbsp; You must look very closely at what this message is saying to you.&nbsp; This is your clue where the problem is.&nbsp; Mof will tell you exactly what is is unable to do
that it is trying to do.&nbsp; These messages are your troubleshooting clues.&nbsp; Don't fall prey to reading the first line and freaking out.&nbsp; Read what it says underneath that.&nbsp; More about that in the section below</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
The <b>third</b> level of problems is when Mof is running in all processes with no file access errors, but things like templates, images, buttons, etc, just aren't doing what you expected them to do.&nbsp; Products are not showing up like you
expected, templates don't look right, etc.&nbsp; These are problems getting the layout, formatting, and product input to work as you want.&nbsp;</font>

These troubleshooting checkpoints are for Unix-Linux type servers only.&nbsp;&nbsp;Double and triple check everything carefully.&nbsp; Many less experienced cgi installers overlook a very simple little procedure, like proper permissions, and seem to
get stuck.&nbsp; Use this as a checklist for your 500 Server Errors.&nbsp; This checklist is not for NT.</font>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">I have seen rare cases where the Hosting Service is running strict Unix and requires that the scripts actually be in Unix format to run.&nbsp; I think concentric.net does this. So, if you're working on a Windows PC, then you'll have to
obtain a plain ASCII text editor capable of SavingAs in Unix format.&nbsp; SaveAs in Unix format before you FTP to your server.&nbsp; This is rare, so I would try this as a last resort.</font>

If you find any of these type of errors you must troubleshoot the problem.&nbsp; The most common error message is when MOF can't find files or directories, or when it can't read or write to files or directories.&nbsp; The message will tell you which
file it is attempting to work with and can't find or use.&nbsp; You'll have to figure out why.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most likely, you have not defined the absolute path correctly in the configuration file.&nbsp; Mof will tell you what file it is trying to
access, not by name but by its function:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p><b>

Check to make sure the configuration settings are correct for the file MOF is attempting to access.&nbsp; You'll have to track down the appropriate configuration file (Tip: which script is running ? mof.cgi or mofpayment.cgi), and the applicable
configuration setting variable.&nbsp; Make sure that you have the correct Absolute Pathway defined for the setting, and make sure the absolute pathway you defined in the setting is exactly where the file resides on the server
and your domain file structure.&nbsp; This is probably the most common installation error.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Merchant OrderForm should give you few errors outside file usage errors.&nbsp; The other possible places Merchant OrderForm will give you error messages is when you start to Build your own Store Front and mess up some of the Rules for submitting a
POST to the Merchant OrderForm system.&nbsp; But this should not happen with the example input pages, since they are already thoroughly tested, and are set up correctly.</font><p>

Then you have errors in how you are constructing your HTML Product Input Pages.&nbsp; Consult the section on <a href="BuildingPages.html">Building your Online store </a>

Our best advice for those of you wanting to install Mof on an NT and MIIS system, is to know what you are doing.&nbsp; If you are experienced with cgi Perl script installations under NT and MIIS, then you will know what to do to make it work.&nbsp;
If you are not experienced with NT and MIIS, then we will offer some very sparse tips:</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
You must realign everything to run as *.pl files.&nbsp; Rename the two main script files to *.pl files instead of *.cgi files.&nbsp; Most NT and MIIS servers run Perl cgi scripts under the extension PL.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Don't worry about the first line in the two main script files, Whereis Perl.&nbsp; NT doesn't use this, it uses the PL extension to identify what type of file it is.</font><p>

Force all Full and absolute pathways for all your file, template, and URL settings.&nbsp; Don's use any relative addressing, but use the complete pathways.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Example: refer to the processing script files with rull URL, don't take it for granted that NT will automatically understand that you want to run mof.pl from the native directory that cgi is running from.</font><p>
<font face="Fixedsys" size="1">
$programfile = 'http://www.domain.net/cgi-bin/mof.pl';</font>
<font FACE="Fixedsys" SIZE="1">
<br>
$paymentfile = 'http://www.domain.net/cgi-bin/mofpayment.pl';</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Again, use very complete absolute addressing for any template file locations:<br>
Make sure you use the backslask and not the forward slash.<br>
Make sure the setting is not enclosed in double quotes.<br>
Using the backslash inside double quotes causes malformed addresses that don't work.</font><p>
<font FACE="Fixedsys" SIZE="1">
$accept_order_template = 'e:\websites\domain\mof15\mofmain.html';</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
If you are referencing a directory then you'll need two ending backslashes.&nbsp; If you don't do this you'll get a 500 Internal Server Error.&nbsp; What happens is that the backslash has powerful meaning in Perl, and you need to tell Perl that you
want a backslash as an literal ending character on the pathway, else, Perl will truncate the ending quote.</font><p>
<font face="Fixedsys" size="1">
$infodirectory = 'e:\websites\domain\orderinfo
<font color="#FF0000">
\\</font>';</font>
<p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
MIIS does not necessarily want to run cgi scripts, since that is a little outside the BG empire, and you could encounter all kinds of problems configuring MIIS to run Perl scripts.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
It's possible that MIIS won't run Perl scripts because of 'require' problems.&nbsp; Mof uses standard directives to require certain support files to run when it loads up.&nbsp; MIIS might not recognize these support files as valid unless you declare
them as valid in @INC and require them using the Full absolute pathway.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
An example using the above pathways to your cgi-bin to force MIIS to run the required support files from the cgi-bin might look like this:</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Declare your support files in @INC when the script starts up.<br>
You'll need to insert lines similar to this as your script starts up.</font>
<p>
<font face="Fixedsys" size="1">
BEGIN {<br>
     push(@INC, 'e:\websites\domain\cgi-bin\mof15.conf');<br>
     push(@INC, 'e:\websites\domain\cgi-bin\mof15_lib.pl');<br>
}</font>
<p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Then all require lines will reference the full absolute address</font>
<font FACE="Fixedsys" SIZE="1">
<p>

require 'e:\websites\domain\cgi-bin\mof15.conf';<br>
require 'e:\websites\domain\cgi-bin\mof15_lib.pl';</p>
</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
The rule if you're having trouble under NT and MIIS is to not leave anything for MIIS or NT to interpret, but force all settings to their absolute location, so NT doesn't have to try to understand what you want to do.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
All settings that would normally run under the native cgi-bin relative location via Unix-Linus should be given full pathways for NT.&nbsp; Don't allow NT to think anything out.</font>
<font FACE="Fixedsys" SIZE="1">
<p>

$use_country_list = 'e:\websites\domain\cgi-bin\countries.txt';<br>
$use_state_list = 'e:\websites\domain\cgi-bin\states.txt';</p>
</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
The above examples should solve your file pathway problems, but the most common problem installing under NT and MIIS is making sure that MIIS and NT are allowing all the required file and directory access privileges.&nbsp; These file and directory
access privileges do not operate like on Unix-Linux.&nbsp; You'll have to contact your admin or hosting help pages to determine what you need to do to get all privilages operating correctly.&nbsp; Sometimes, the cgi-bin under NT systems is not even
set up to execute PL files, so you'll need to contact someone to even have that enabled.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Lastly, before Mof will be able to mail you anything, you'll need to have a sendmail compatible mailer installed under the NT and MIIS system.&nbsp; We'll try to construct a Mof plugin that works with SMTP directly for NT.&nbsp; You can check out <a href="http://www.merchantorderform.com/support.html">support

Merchant OrderForm uses two directories to read, write, and store data for cart products and shipping information.&nbsp; Mof creates a separate file for each customer, for both cart products and shipping address information.&nbsp; The current version
1.53 of Mof does not have any provisions for cleaning out these scratch files.&nbsp; Scratch files are made in these directories.</font><p>
<font face="Fixedsys" size="1">

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
You should periodically check these directories, sort them by date files were created or modified, and delete any files in either of those directories that are older than the corresponding cookies settings you have for the cart and shipping
information.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
I have several thousand files operating out of one of my directories, so you don't need to worry that you may have accumulated many files.&nbsp; Unix-Linus is capable of housing many files without problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
You have cookie settings in <b>

</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Any files that are older than your cookie settings can be safely deleted.&nbsp; Any scratch files that are older than the cookie settings you have will not be used by Mof because even if the customer does return to your site, their reference number
for stored information has been expired as an active cookie.&nbsp; So go ahead and delete any of these files.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Don't worry.&nbsp; It's okay to delete all the files if you want to.&nbsp; The worst that will happen is the customer will have to complete their shipping information again, or they will not have a saved cart.&nbsp; Mof will know to create them a new
file, even if there is a cookie reference, but their file has been deleted.</font>

The two main cgi files for Merchant OrderForm called 
<font color="#000080">
<b>mof.cgi </b></font>and 
<font color="#000080">
<b>mofpayment.cgi</b></font> identify where the Perl interpreter is located on your server.&nbsp; This is done on the very first line of each of these script files.&nbsp; They are set in the package for the standard location of Perl on most
Unix-Linux type servers.&nbsp; In rare cases you may need to modify this line to point to the location of the Perl interpreter if your server has it located in a different place than the one we have set:</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Most Unix-Linux type servers use this location for Perl:</font>
<font FACE="Fixedsys" SIZE="1">
<br>
#!/usr/bin/perl</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
If your server uses a different location, then you should be certain what that location is, and replace the first line in both 
<font color="#000080">

<font color="#000080">

<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Then Merchant OrderForm will not operate.&nbsp; You could get the server message: 500 Internal Server Error.&nbsp; This is not common and you shouldn't assume this is the case unless you have reason to suspect it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
The most common cause of corruption with these files is when you are editing them.&nbsp; Beginners make mistakes, leaving off a quote, changing a single quote to double quote or visa versa, accidentally deleting the semicolon which ends every
function or command.&nbsp; Any erroneous alteration of the Perl language syntax within the scripts will cause the script to fail when the Perl interpreter attempts to compile or execute the script.&nbsp; The language within the scripts themselves is
not forgiving like html.</font>

<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Unfortunately, the only way to check if the scripts are corrupted is to use the Perl interpreter to check them.&nbsp; The beginner cgi installer may not have access to this or know how to call it directly.&nbsp; So, if you suspect the files are
corrupted then you might try downloading the package again, and moving through the initial install carefully.</font>

<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
If you have access to the Perl interpreter then you simply need to call a -c (code check) on the file.<br>
</font>
<font face="Fixedsys" size="1">
perl -c filename.cgi</font>

<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
This will tell you if the code is okay or what line there are syntax errors.<br>
You can do this from Telnet, from the Unix-Linux command shell, or from a DOS shell if on NT or Winxx</font>

If you have the Mof front end installed under regular non-secure HTTP protocol, and have the Mof back end installed under the secure HTTPS (SSL) protocol, then you have some meticulous double checking to do.&nbsp; The rule is this: any object that
could possibly come up under the SSL connection (being run via mofpayment.cgi), just have a reference to the secure HTTPS location of that object.&nbsp; This means any image, cart buttons, logos, template images, images for products placed in your
cart, etc.&nbsp; You'll have to track down just exactly where the culprit is, which image is still being called via the non-secure HTTP URL.&nbsp;</font>

<b>There are three places non-secure images could be coming from.</b></font></p>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
<font color="#000080">
<b>First</b></font>, the configuration file itself.&nbsp; See the section above for mofpayment.conf for a detailed list of what images are referenced by this file.&nbsp; These settings will call on navigation buttons, validation cue images, the
paypal button, and background images for the Ship To and Bill To tabs on the Final invoice.</font></p>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
<font color="#000080">
<b>Second</b></font>, the two templates that the Final Processing uses to collect Billing information and display the Final Invoice could have standard references to images, rather than the SSL reference.</font></p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="-1">
../mof15/<b>mofpayinfo.html</b></font><li>
<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="-1">
../mof15/<b>mofpayfinal.html</b></font>
</ul>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
If you want to test to see if those two templates above are secure: Then call them up in your browser independent of the script.  Just put in the Full HTTPS url to your browser address.  Does the template page load without any "insecure items" messages ? If it doesn't load in the plain browser as secure, then it will not load as secure when the script uses it.  Make these tests to any templates that the script will be using under the SSL.</font></p>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
<font color="#000080">
<b>Third</b></font>, you could be using the picture function in your cart, placing images of your products into your cart, and those image src img=&quot;HTTP ..&quot; regular image references. You must reference any of these images from the beginning
as under SSL, so that when you get to the Final Invoice the URL is HTTPS.&nbsp; They will end up however they start out.&nbsp; The Final Invoice doesn't magically know to convert how you referenced them.</font></p>
<P>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Tip: To trouble shoot where the non-secure image is coming from, view the html source for the page that triggers the non-secure message. Then do a search for http, not https.&nbsp; Look closely at every image reference in the source and make sure if
it is an image then it is referenced using HTTP only.&nbsp; Any HTTP reference for an image call will trigger the dreaded message you are so diligently trying to get rid of.&nbsp; Remember: a reference in the html source may have its origins in
either the configuration file, one of the template files, or even from placing pictures into your cart.</font>
