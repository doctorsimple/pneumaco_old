Q: What Is Merchant OrderForm v1.53 ?</font></p>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
A: A Professional shopping cart system for gathering products from a Web site and processing invoices.&nbsp; At the time this documentation was written, Merchant OrderForm was released as a stand-alone system, meaning that is does all the shopping
cart functions, and for final processing it emails the merchant when an order is placed.&nbsp; Please consult the <a href="http://www.merchantorderform.com/updates.html">Updates Page</a>
 to determine what Plug-ins have been written for connection to authorization services.&nbsp; This version 1.53 also has a built in payment option for PayPal's Web Accept.&nbsp; It is also pretty easy to integrate MOF with any type of Web Link that
services provide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Technically Speaking, Merchant OrderForm v1.53 are CGI scripts written in Perl v5.01</font></p>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Merchant OrderForm are Perl CGI scripts, which means they are plain ASCII script files written in Perl v5.01 designed to run under a Web servers CGI (Common Gateway Interface).&nbsp; They are made with Unix or Linux type servers in mind, but can be
installed to run under a Win32 platform like Win_xx or NT with a few considerations.</font></p>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
It's a Web Development tool for E-Commerce that is versatile in its look and feel and not locked into performing in only one way.  The more serious the Web Developer's level of skill, the more they will be able to see possibilities for using Merchant OrderForm
v1.53 to bridge Web Site Products into invoices for processing.  It provides Shopping Cart capabilities, OrderForm capabilities, and much more.&nbsp;
Some developers link PHP search results, or Db searches, to Merchant OrderForm.</font>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Merchant OrderForm is mainly a tool for the Web Developer; however, it is seriously usable for the wannabies or novices who want to invest a little time in familiarizing themselves with installing and configuring CGI scripts.&nbsp; There are hosting
services that make generic shopping carts available to your web site which are much easier to set up and use for the beginner, but many of these generic carts restrict you to general use, with little customizing ability.&nbsp; Merchant OrderForm is a
serious tool to enable an e-Commerce Web Site’s products to be carted, invoiced, previewed, purchased in extremely customizable ways.</font>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Merchant OrderForm is used on Web Sites.&nbsp; So, you need a Web Site.&nbsp; Almost all commercial Web Space has everything that MOF needs to run successfully. If a hosting service did not have the basics for Merchant OrderForm to run, then you should be wary of their service. Here are the details:</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
It runs best on a Unix or Linux type server (common with hosting services)<br>
It can be installed on NT with some adjustments, and requires a different mail plug-in<br>
<br>
</font><li>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
You'll need ability to run independent cgi Perl scripts on your account (common on commercial accounts)<br>
Your server must have Perl v5.01 or higher installed (standard)<br>
<br>
</font><li>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
You'll need FTP (File Transfer Protocol) access to upload the files to your server (standard)<br>
So, you'll need an FTP program to work with on your machine (software)<br>
Or you'll need a Web based control panel for uploading files to your Web Space (provided by some hosts)<br>
<br>
</font><li>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
You'll need ability to set Permissions (Unix, Linux) for the executable and writable files (standard)<br>
Many FTP programs do this, or a hosting service's Web Based Control Panel will do this<br>
If installing on NT, your admin will need to give your cgi-bin folder executable-writable permission</font>
</ol>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Okay, that will get you up and running; however, we have some recommendations that will insure safety and security when using Merchant OrderForm on your Web site:</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
If you plan on using SSL (Secure Sockets Layers) for collecting sensitive info (recommended)<br>
Then you'll need SSL services on your account (common on commercial accounts)<br>
Note: You do not need SSL if you will not be collecting actual credit card numbers or checking account numbers<br>
<br>
</font><li>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
We recommend that you install it and use it on a well configured Virtual Domain<br>
Where your cgi-bin is configured by the Web Server to prohibit a directory listing<br>
And prohibits execution of any file not listed as *.cgi for executable cgi usage.<br>
This is the strongest configured cgi-bin and should be provided by good quality hosting services<br>
If you do not have this then consult the section on <a href="Installation.html#OtherInstallIssues">Other Installation Issues<br>
<br>
</a>
</font><li>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
We also recommend that your Virtual domain account have Root Directory Access.<br>
Meaning that you have access to the Root of your account one directory above Public Web Access<br>
Our installation instructions recommend that all scratch files use directories out of range of Public<br>
Web Access.
If you do not have this then consult the section on<a href="Installation.html#OtherInstallIssues"> Other Installation Issues<br>
</a>

If you are 
<font color="#000080">
<b>experienced</b></font> at installing Perl CGI scripts, then jump right in.&nbsp; Once you get over the initial shock of how enormous the configuration files are, you will see things are really quite organized and simply laid out in 6 main files.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
If you are a 
<font color="#000080">
<b>beginner</b></font>,&nbsp; attempting to install Perl CGI scripts on your Web Site, then you will need a little courage and patience.&nbsp; Our documentation is very thorough, and will lead you through the process, even teach you the basics of
running CGI scripts, but you must be willing to follow directions.&nbsp; Our previous version of Merchant OrderForm has been used by several schools to teach beginning and intermediate CGI programming.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
The most important thing is that you be able to follow directions closely.&nbsp; You should not jump over any of the installation section, unless you are experienced at installing Perl CGI scripts.&nbsp; Our first direction is to not jump
ahead.&nbsp; You should not even look at the configuration files except in the areas we direct for the initial install.&nbsp; The configuration files can be a little intimidating to beginners.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080">
What you need to install it:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Ability to make Web pages with Forms for your products (Your HTML Editor)</font><li>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
A plain ASCII text Editor (not notepad, it doesn't handle large files)</font>
</ul>
<p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
You'll need some understanding of how to build html forms for your product pages, or you'll need some willingness to learn a little of this.&nbsp; We have plenty of examples and will walk you through it, but the more web page building experience you
have the better.&nbsp; MOF does all its work when something is sent to it from a Web page Form.&nbsp; You can build your product input pages using your favorite HTML Editor.&nbsp; Our documentation has a whole section on </font>

If you need an FTP program the <a href="http://www.nonags.com/">Nonags Site</a>
 has those.&nbsp; It's a good idea to find one that has the ability to set Unix-Linux permissions.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ipswitch.com/cgi/download_eval.pl?product=WL-1000">WS-FTP LE</a>
 has that feature.&nbsp; Also, the makers of WS-FTP have tutorials on <a href="http://www.ftpplanet.com/ftpresources/ftpmain.htm">how to use FTP </a>
if you're unfamiliar with that.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
If you don't have a plain ASCII text editor check out the <a href="http://www.nonags.com/">Nonags Site</a>
.&nbsp; They have plenty of Freeware notepad replacements.&nbsp; You could use Wordpad, but be careful not to use any of the formatting. It's safer to just use a plain ASCII editor.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
You must use a plain ASCII text editor to edit any of MOF's program files.&nbsp; We have some search and replace techniques that prepare these files for the initial installation, but once you get down into the meat of refining MOF's behavior on your
site, then we will have to go deep into the configuration files and start making settings.&nbsp; This will be the hardest part for the beginner, but we'll walk you through it.</font><p>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
And remember: we provide installation services, customizing services, and have a 99% email answering reputation. Merchant OrderForm is extremely affordable if you want to do it all yourself, but if you need support we recommend our Web Developers
level of service.&nbsp; We offer limited support for both Web Developers registrations, and will try to help you with any obstacles you're having.&nbsp; Please consult our <a href="http://www.merchantorderform.com/custom.html">service fees </a>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
Merchant OrderForm is a set of Perl scripts.&nbsp; They are not Windows programs, and will not run as native Windows programs.&nbsp; They are script files full of plain text lines that do nothing at all in Windows except look pretty confusing in your
text editor.&nbsp; You can edit them with any plain ASCII text editor on any computer.&nbsp; Their power is when they are installed under a Web Servers CGI (common gateway interface), then they have action power.&nbsp; But they are plain text on a
Windows machine.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
If you are new to installing CGI scripts for a Web Site, and downloading this package to your Windows PC, then your job will be to uncompress (unzip) the downloaded package and follow the instructions in this documentation for Installation.&nbsp; You
will be Transferring the program files via FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to your Web Server, and you will be making some adjustments to the configuration files for the program to run.&nbsp; But you will not be attempting to run the scripts on your
Windows PC.</font></p>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
You can work with the scripts on your Windows PC, but the scripts are made to run under a Web Server (like Apache) on Unix or Linux type servers.&nbsp; Front page does not edit or install CGI scripts and you should not attempt to use Front Page to
install Merchant OrderForm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>

<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
If you want to run Merchant OrderForm on your Windows PC, then you should have the Active State Perl build installed under a local Web Server. You’ll need both installed: a Web Server (software) and the Perl Interpreter.&nbsp; Then you’ll have to
configure your Web Server software to run *.PL or *.CGI scripts via the Common Gateway Interface and the Perl Interpreter. At that point Merchant OrderForm will operate out of your standard Web Browser, as if it were actually on the Internet, but
running on your Windows machine instead.&nbsp; Merchant OrderForm v1.53 was completely built from a Windows98 machine using Active Perl and the Omni HTTPd Web server.&nbsp; All of it's functions were tested on a Linux machine running the Apache Web
Server.</font></p>

Yes, you can use MS Personal Web Server, but configuring it to run Perl via the CGI is not a friendly process.&nbsp; If you want to do this, consult the Usenet discussions for PWS.<br>

Version 1.53 has a built in option to use the PayPal Web Accept service.&nbsp; Mof can be configured to use only the PayPal service, or that service can be user selected from any of the other Payment Methods you enable.</font><P>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
PayPal's Web Accept service is a good example of how Merchant OrderForm can be easily customized to send final amounts and information to any simple Web Link type service.&nbsp; The API's require some additional programming, but the Web Link services
can be customized with just a little knowledge of how to work inside the scripts and install some custom submit buttons with hidden input.</font>
<P>
<font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">
We have included a section on customizing Mof to submit it's final information to a Web Link type service.&nbsp; This can be found in the Configurations section of the documentation.</font>
