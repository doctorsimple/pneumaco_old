<strong>Shopping Cart Message </strong>
<font color=black>
<p>


You have been directed to this page for one of two reasons:

<ol>
<li>You have not put anything into your cart
<li>Your browser is not accepting cookies
</ol>



<p>

You may be requesting to View Your Cart but have not 
 placed anything into your cart yet.  If so, you'll need to 
 return to the site's shopping pages, and place something into 
 your cart to initialize a cart so you can view it.

<p>

If you have placed at least one item already into your cart, and 
 find yourself at this page, it is because your browser is not 
 accepting cookies. You have attempted to call a cart function, 
 but your browser did not allow a cookie to be set to initialize
 your shopping cart. In a rare case your browser may have lost our 
 cookies reference to your order.

<p>

You browser may be configured in its settings 
 to refuse cookies being sent to it, or you may have manually refused to 
 accept the cookie.  In order to use Shopping on this site, we need to set a 
 harmless reference number for your orders.  
 The number is meaningless, and contains absolutely no information about you, 
 your internet activities, email, or anything else.  

 The number is a long number, which has meaning only to the 
 shopping system while you are shopping.

<p>
